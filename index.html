        <p>Hello! I am Dallin Jackson, this is me with my wife Taylor. I am a Computer Science undergrad
        at Brigham Young University, currently in my Sophomore year. I am from Longmont, Colorado mostly, I have lived
        in the UK and in Santiago, Chile for a couple of years each, but I consider myself from Colorado. I love the
        mountains and snow. I am excited for my future career in the tech industry, I am learning about robotics and AI
        and hope to build smart medical robots (think Bayamax from Big Hero 6). I want people to be positively helped
        in human-robot interactions, so my goal is to learn how to build devices that will be capable enough to do
        things that we can't do for ourselves, but in a respectful way where the person is primarily in control of the
        event. </p>

        <img src="images/familybygrandcanyon.jpg" alt="My family at Grand Canyon.">
        <p>This is my family. I am the oldest of five kids, with two brothers and two sisters. They're all very
        smart and talented, and they are my best friends. A few months after I married Taylor, we went with them to see the Grand
        Canyon. My brother Sam isn't in this picture, he is currently in Guyana serving as a missionary for the
        Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Their names (from left to right) are Taylor (my wife), me, Kaylie,
        Nathan, Addie, and Preston.</p>

        <p>I love finding solutions and building cool things. This website serves as both an about me page
        and as a place to see some fun projects I've made along with my Resume. If you are interested
        in doing a project with me or want to reach out for whatever reason, don't hesitate to. Thanks for visiting
        my site!</p>
